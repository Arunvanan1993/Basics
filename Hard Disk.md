What is Magnetic Drive?

Rotating magnetic drives, your cheapest solution in terms of large storage space.

What Is an HDD?

1. An HDD is a data storage device that lives inside the computer. It has spinning disks inside where data is stored magnetically. The HDD has an arm with several "heads" (transducers) that read and write data on the disk. 
2. HDDs are considered a legacy technology, meaning they’ve been around longer than SSDs. In general, they are lower in cost and are practical for data that does not need to be accessed frequently, such as backups of photos, videos or business files. They are available in two common form factors: 2.5 inch (commonly used in laptops) and 3.5 inch (desktop computers)

What Is an SSD?

1. SSDs got their name—solid state—because they use solidstate devices under the hood. In an SSD, all data is stored in integrated circuits. 
2. This difference from HDDs has a lot of implications, especially in size and performance. Without the need for a spinning disk, SSDs can reduce to the shape and size of a stick of gum (what’s known as the M.2 form factor) or even as small as a postage stamp.
3. Their capacity—or how much data they can hold—varies, making them flexible for smaller devices, such as slim laptops, convertibles, or 2 in 1s. And SSDs dramatically reduce access time since users don’t have to wait for platter rotation to start up.
4. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs per amount of storage (in gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB)), but the gap is closing as SSD prices decline at a faster pace that HDD prices year over year.


Type of SSDs.
----------------------
1. SATA SSD

SATA SSDs are the first generation of SSDs. They can reach a read speed of up to 570MB per second. These first-generation SSDs are generally 5 times faster than a traditional HDD. The most common SATA variant in laptops is a 2.5-inch SSD. These SSDs start your laptop within 15 seconds and load large games within mere moments.

2. NVMe SSD

NVMe is a protocol that allows you to reach even higher speeds than with a SATA SSD. This means an NVMe SSD can reach a read speed of 2600MB per second. That's almost 5 times as fast as a SATA drive! Do you use large zip files a lot? If so, we recommend a laptop with NVMe M.2.


Similarities between HDD and SDD:
--------------------------------------
1. Both are used to store data.
2. Both are used to boot the system.
3. Both are I/O devices.
4. Differences between HDD and SDD :

Parameter	               HDD	                                                SSD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Form	                  HDD stands for Hard Disk Drive.	                        SSD stands for Solid State Drive.
Components	                HDD contains moving mechanical parts, like the arm.	    SSD does not contains, mechanical parts, only electronical parts like ICs.
R/W Time	                  HDD has longer R/W time.	                              SSD has shorter R/W time..
Latency	                    HDD has higher latency.	                                SSD has lower latency.
I/O operations per second   HDD supports fewer I/O operations per second.	          SSD supports more I/O operations per second.
Fragmentation	              HDD has fragmentation.	                                SSD do not has fragmentation.
Weight	                    HDD is heavier in weight.	                              SSD is lighter in weight.
Size	                      HDD is larger in size.	                                SSD is more compact in size
